## Repo overview
This repository contains code for the DTU Course 02456, Deep Learning, and has been made to accomodate the need for a clean repository with runnable notebooks.

For practical purposes of running training jobs on a remote GPU, the primary results from the hand-in has been obtained by running a the various training .py files within the /experiments folder of this repo https://github.com/jalkestrup/llm2vec-dtu - which is a forked and slightly modified version of the original LLM2Vec repo https://github.com/McGill-NLP/llm2vec/ (to accomodate for new datasets).
